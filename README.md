`Diff coverage maven plugin` builds [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) compatible code coverage report of new and modified code based on a provided [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format). 

The plugin is able to check and fail a build if code coverage rules are not met.

## How it works 
`Diff coverage` works in tandem with JaCoCo and requires JaCoCo to be applied to a project as well.
The plugin does the next steps:
* analyzes coverage data('.exec' files generated by JaCoCo)
* cuts off all code coverage data that wasn't modified
* checks violation rules if any are set up
* builds diff coverage HTML report. See [HTML report example](#Report-example)

## Maven goal description 
`Diff Coverage Maven plugin` has a single goal `diffCoverage` that is bind to `verify` phase 
```shell script
# run tests and build diff coverage report
mvn clean verify

# Invoke the goal explicitly.
# It depends on `test` phase, make sure it's called when coverage data(*.exec files) already generated.  
mvn clean test diff-coverage:diffCoverage
```

## Report example
Maven output on failed violation rules:
```
[INFO] File src/main/kotlin/org/example/Hello.kt has 5 modified lines
[INFO] New violation: Rule violated for bundle untitled: instructions covered ratio is 0.4, but expected minimum is 0.7
[INFO] New violation: Rule violated for bundle untitled: lines covered ratio is 0.6, but expected minimum is 0.7
[WARNING] Fail on violations: true. Found violations: 2.

The plugin creates JaCoCo like HTML, XML and CSV reports in directory `target/site/diffCoverage/`.
